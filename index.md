# UtilityHotbar

## About me
* I have been coding since ~2018.
* I program [simulations](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/civsim), [tools](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/showmd/), [toy compilers/languages](https://zhengzi-archive.com/terminal/), [games](progress_game/index.html), and [multimedia projects/ARGs](https://aulddaegs.github.io/)
* My research interests include responsible uses for Large Language Models, AI safety/interpretability (e.g. occlusion sensitivity or risks from unscoped models with broad capabilities), Natural Language Processing (e.g. topic modelling, textual comprehension, and POS tagging) and the institutional incentives for developing AI technology.

## Research
* [**Harms from Increasingly Agentic Systems**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10329) - A paper I was a co-author on, talking about the risks from AI systems we are yielding autonomy to.
* [**AI Generated Multimodal Disinformation Networks**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF7c2OOwyw4) - Conference presentation demonstrating some of the capabilities for AI to be used for complex disinformation narratives.

## Major Projects
* [**Socratides**](https://socratides.streamlit.app/) - A demo for a narrow AI system that generates human understandable and editable knowledge graphs out of texts that can be pruned and refined to enhance textual analysis. Source code [here](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/autoratiocinator).
* [**The Savage Computers**](https://aulddaegs.github.io) - A modern web novel about AI, climate change, and the present state of the world. Includes interactive and non-linear elements. Shortlisted for the UK's [New Media Writing Prize](https://newmediawritingprize.co.uk/) Student Prize.
* [**Zhengzi Archive**](https://zhengzi-archive.com/) - Online facing part of an ARG I ran.
* [**Civsim**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/civsim) - Automated generation of civilisations and simulation of their growth and decay.
* [**Journey**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/journey) - Automated D&D questing.
* [**Shellsim**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/shellsim) - A self-contained simulation of a bash like shell: piping, streaming, internal filesystem

## Writing
* [**The Savage Computers**](https://aulddaegs.github.io) - In progress web novel and interactive archive of in-universe documents.
* [**Automatic Memory - Issue N**](https://nakade.itch.io/automatic-memory-n) - A zine made by me (graphic design + words).
* [**The Shape of Minds to Come**](shapeofminds/index.html) - Essay on in-progress mentalities we might develop to face the future.

* [**High Times at the Happy Hour Hotel**](https://nakade.itch.io/the-happy-hour-hotel) - Text adventure in a Laundry Files-esque setting with a  somewhat complex inventory system.
* [**NOVOS Emulator**](https://zhengzi-archive.com/terminal/) - An assembly language programming game with a Zachtronics-style manual and 5 levels.
* [**Saturday Night One Shot**](https://nakade.itch.io/saturday-night-one-shot) - D&D themed, simple roguelike with a hand-drawn aesthetic based on [rough.js](https://roughjs.com/).

* [**Catacombs of Steel**](https://utilityhotbar.github.io/catacombs) - Automated dungeon crawler/roguelike simulation.

## Minor Projects
* [**Yet Another Web Toolkit**](yawt_demo/index.html) - A web playground for developing games, applets, slides, or small fixed-viewport websites.
* [**Showmd**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/showmd/) - Displays markdown files in a semi-pretty way in the shell.
* [**oldbook.css**](https://github.com/UtilityHotbar/oldbook-css) - A CSS theme that simulates old books. For some reason, my most popular project by far. No JS needed.
* [**neoweb.css**](https://utilityhotbar.github.io/neoweb/) - Another CSS theme, with a demo page. No JS needed.
* [**ARG Tools**](https://utilityhotbar.github.io/args/) - Tools for running and making ARGs.

## Old Stuff
